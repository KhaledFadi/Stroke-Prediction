# **Stroke Prediction**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the likelihood of a stroke using machine learning. The project explores health and demographic data to identify patterns and provide actionable insights.

## **Project Overview**

Stroke is a major health concern worldwide, often leading to severe outcomes if not addressed early. This project focuses on:

- Analyzing stroke risk factors.
- Building predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- Identifying key contributors to stroke risk through data-driven insights.

## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values and standardizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries of the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancements to optimize the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Evaluation of various machine learning algorithms.
- **Prediction**: Application of the best-performing model on unseen data.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhaledFadi/stroke-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stroke-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stroke_prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow these steps within the notebook:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes features such as:

- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Smoking Status
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Average Glucose Levels

> **Note**: Ensure the dataset file is in the correct directory as specified in the notebook.

## **Models Implemented**

The following machine learning models were developed and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting

Model performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **Results**

The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most effective model, achieving an accuracy of **X%** on the test set. Detailed performance metrics and comparisons are provided in the notebook.
